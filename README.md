# ETL Project README

## Overview
Provide a brief introduction to your ETL project. Explain its purpose, what data it processes, and any goals or objectives.

## Prerequisites
List all software dependencies and tools required to run your ETL project. Include links to where each can be obtained.

>   Docker
>   Visual Studio Code
>   PostgreSQL database
>   Python 3.x
>   Required Python packages (list them with pip install -r requirements.txt)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
2. Start Docker Containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This command starts the PostgreSQL database and Adminer (optional for database management).

3. Create Python Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
4. Install Python Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Project Structure
Describe the structure of your project directory. Explain where to find important files, such as:

>   etl.py: Main ETL script
>   docker-compose.yml: Docker configuration
>   data/: Directory for storing input data
>   README.md: Documentation file (this file)

## Running the ETL Process
1. Prepare Input Data:
   Place your CSV file(s) in the data/ directory.

2. Run the ETL Script:

```
python etl.py
```
   This script extracts data from CSV, transforms it (optional), and loads it into PostgreSQL.

## Database Management
.   Accessing Adminer:
   Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080. Use the PostgreSQL login details to manage your database via Adminer.

### Additional Notes
   Include any additional information that might be relevant or helpful for someone using or contributing to your project.

Troubleshooting
Provide solutions to common issues or errors that users might encounter.

License
Specify the license under which your project is distributed.
